# TicTacToe-Game-
Hi, I have uploaded the codes of simple game developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


//Game
We have 9 boxes in a matrix shape.
and we have 2 players

1. We have 2 symbols known as "X" and "O"
2. Any player can choose any symbol when he/she starts playing the game.
3. Suppose player 1 chooses "X" and puts in a box and player 2 chooses "O"
and puts in another box and so on.
4. Whenever any horizontal/ vertical or diagonal row/column gets filled
by same symbol by any player than that player wins the game.
5. Hence they are some winning patterns to actually build this game.


Imagine a matrix

0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

winning patterns

Horizontal Patterns
0 1 2 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)
3 4 5 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)
6 7 8 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)

vertical Patterns
0 3 6 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)
1 4 7 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)
2 5 8 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)

Diagonal Patterns
0 4 8 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)
2 4 6 (all 3 can X X X or O O O)
